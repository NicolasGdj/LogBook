# Personal GitHub Activity Mirror

## Purpose

This repository serves as a **public mirror of my private development activity**. For every real commit I make on private company repositories, a corresponding commit is made here — solely to reflect that activity on my GitHub contribution graph.

## Context

- I currently work on private repositories hosted on internal or self-hosted Git platforms (e.g., GitLab, Gitea).
- These projects are subject to strict confidentiality: **no code, no business logic, no internal context** is published or exposed.
- However, I believe in keeping a transparent, truthful record of my actual development activity.

## How it works

- For each commit I make on a private repository, I create a matching commit here.
- These commits:
  - Do **not** include any source code or sensitive content.
  - Contain a generic log message, timestamp, or neutral comment.
  - May be **antidated** using Git if the original activity was in the past.

## Compliance & Integrity

This approach respects:
- ✅ GitHub’s contribution rules — each commit is real, authored by me, and uses my verified email
- ✅ Company confidentiality — no proprietary code or information is ever shared
- ✅ Ethical standards — there is no artificial contribution inflation, only a 1-to-1 trace of actual work

## Why this matters

Developer contributions on GitHub are often used as a proxy for engagement and consistency. This repository ensures that my **true day-to-day activity** is visible, while strictly respecting professional and legal boundaries.
